								<h2>FAITH-BASED STATEMENT FOR L.O.V.E.M. </h2>
								<p>WE BELIEVE:  That God is One (Deuteronomy 6:4) Omnipotent (Possessing all power); Omniscient (Having all Knowledge); Omnipresent (whose Presence fills the Universe and beyond).  He is the Father in creation, Son in redemption, and the Holy Ghost is His comforting, keeping and transforming power.</p>
								<p>WE BELIEVE:  That God was in Christ Jesus, reconciling the world into Himself (2 Corinthians5:19), that Jesus is the incarnate Word, God made flesh.  (John 1:14).  The angel told Joseph to call His name “JESUS”.  For he shall save His people from their sins (Matthew 1:21), and “There is no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved”. (Acts 4:12).  That God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the gentiles believed in the world, and received up into glory (1 Timothy 3:16).</p>

<p>WE BELIEVE:  In water baptism by immersion and the only way to fulfill the commission of our Lord, (Matthew 28:19) “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost”.  In this passage, Jesus instructs us to carry out this instruction NOT to simply repeat these words.  The disciples understood and baptized all converts in the name of Jesus (Acts 2:38, 8:16, 10:48, & 19:5).</p>

<p>WE BELIEVE:  In order to enter the Kingdom of God, one must be born of the water and of the spirit (John 3:5).  That when the Holy Spirit comes into one’s heart he will speak in other tongues just as they did in the bible times as a sign of the in-filling (Acts 2:4, 10:46, & 19:5).WE BELIEVE:  The second coming of Jesus Christ (Matthew 24:30, Acts 1:11, Philippians &3:20,21), at which time the true church shall be caught away with him into the heavens.</p>

<p>WE BELIEVE:  In the final judgment (Matthew 25:4; Revelation 20:12-15; 21:8): A literal heaven and a burning hell (Revelation 20:15; 21:8). That Jesus Christ truly is the answer.</p>

								<h2>Helping the People</h2>

We Minister to those who are lost, hurting, distressed, and discontented with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Ultimately leading them to an authentic relationship with God.  In the L.O.V.E M, the body of Jesus Christ, help the people.</p>
